Commands Learned so far:

git init
--> create a new Git repository or convert existing project to Git repository
-- usually the first thing to do

touch filename.filetype
--> create file

git status
--> shows the current state or staging area, indicates and tracks changes
-- helpful when performing other commands

git add
--> adds changes made in the directory to the staging area
-- extension to command --
-> git add *.filetype --> add all files with the same filetype
-> git add . --> add all files

git commit
--> perform changes in index or save files or changes
--> holds and displays the changes to the local repository 
--> aka provides a snapshot 
-- extension to command --
-> git commit -m 'Enter comment' --> shortcut for instantly putting comments and avoiding the comment screen
-> git commit -am 'Enter comment' --> add and commit at the same time but only works for changes on existing files

git branch
--> displays the branches (asterisk means that it is the active branch)
-- extension to command --
git branch branchname --> creates a new branch
git branch -d branchname --> delete a branch

git checkout
--> switch branches
-- extension to command --
git checkout branchname -> switch to branch
git checkout -b branchname -> create a branch and switch to it

git merge
--> combine branches
-- extension to command --
git merge branchname -> combine the current active branch with the entered branchname
-- merging branches does not delete the other branch

git push
--> push to remote repository or upload Git commits
-- extension to command --
git push origin branchname -> push to remote repository
git push -u origin branchname -> creates an upstream tracking connection (usually done if publishing local branch to remote for the first time)

git pull
